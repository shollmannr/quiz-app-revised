Meetings with instructors

An instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time to approve your project.

You will meet with an instructor for 15 minutes to get your game idea approved. Be sure to write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP and some stretch goal ideas. How to Submit Your Project

Submit your github link.

You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors. Where to go for help during project week

Suggested Ways to Get Started

Wireframe Make a drawing of what your app will look like in all of the stages of the game (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like while the player is playing? What does it look like when the player wins / loses?).

Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

(Links to an external site.)Think about...

Creativity
Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

Code Quality
Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

Problem Solving
Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
